# Outlook MCP Server - Project Overview

## Project Description

The Outlook MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides programmatic access to Microsoft Outlook mailboxes, including both personal inboxes and shared mailboxes, through standardized tools. This server enables AI assistants and other MCP clients to analyze email chains, track alert histories, and extract actionable insights from organizational email communications.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Enable seamless integration between MCP clients and Microsoft Outlook mailboxes (both personal and shared)
- Provide structured access to email chain analysis and alert tracking capabilities across all accessible mailboxes
- Support production environment monitoring workflows through comprehensive email-based alert analysis
- Deliver well-formatted, AI-parseable responses for enhanced decision-making support

### Secondary Goals
- Maintain cross-compatibility with various MCP client implementations
- Ensure robust error handling and connection management for enterprise environments
- Provide configurable access patterns for different organizational structures
- Support scalable deployment across multiple mailbox configurations (personal and shared)

## Technical Architecture

### Platform Requirements
- **Operating System**: Microsoft Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Email Client**: Microsoft Outlook (desktop application)
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: pywin32, MCP SDK, additional supporting libraries

### Core Components
- **MCP Server Framework**: Implements the Model Context Protocol specification
- **Outlook Integration Layer**: Utilizes Win32 COM interface for Outlook connectivity
- **Email Analysis Engine**: Processes email chains and extracts structured information
- **Alert Tracking System**: Maintains historical context for recurring alert patterns
- **Response Formatter**: Ensures AI-readable output formatting

## Functional Specifications

### Tool 1: Email Chain Summarization
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive summaries of email threads based on subject line matching across personal inbox and shared mailboxes

**Input Parameters**:
- Email subject line or partial subject match
- Date range filters (optional)
- Mailbox scope (personal, shared, or both)
- Thread depth limitations

**Output Structure**:
- Thread metadata (participants, timeline, message count, source mailboxes)
- Chronological message summaries
- Key action items identified
- Participant response patterns
- Resolution status indicators
- Cross-mailbox conversation tracking

### Tool 2: Alert History Analysis
**Purpose**: Track and analyze historical responses to production monitoring alerts across personal inbox and shared mailboxes, with primary focus on shared mailbox production responses

**Input Parameters**:
- Alert identifier or pattern matching criteria
- Lookback time period
- Response classification filters
- Escalation level indicators
- Mailbox priority (shared mailbox primary, personal inbox secondary)

**Output Structure**:
- Alert frequency analysis across all mailboxes
- Historical response patterns and source locations
- Action timeline reconstruction with mailbox attribution
- Resolution success metrics
- Escalation pathway mapping
- Related incident correlations
- Cross-mailbox alert distribution tracking

### Tool 3: Mailbox Access Management
**Purpose**: Provide controlled access to personal and shared mailbox resources

**Input Parameters**:
- Mailbox access credentials
- Mailbox type specification (personal, shared)
- Folder specification
- Access permission levels
- Connection timeout parameters

**Output Structure**:
- Connection status verification for all accessible mailboxes
- Available folder enumeration per mailbox
- Access permission confirmation
- Mailbox availability status
- Error status reporting

## Data Processing Framework

### Email Chain Processing
- **Thread Reconstruction**: Intelligently groups related messages using subject patterns, reply-to relationships, and conversation IDs
- **Content Extraction**: Processes email bodies, headers, and attachments for relevant information
- **Participant Analysis**: Tracks sender/recipient patterns and response behaviors
- **Timeline Construction**: Creates chronological sequences of communications and actions

### Alert Correlation Engine
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring alert signatures and classification patterns
- **Response Mapping**: Links alerts to subsequent actions and resolution attempts
- **Escalation Tracking**: Monitors alert lifecycle from initial notification to resolution
- **Impact Assessment**: Correlates alert frequency with business impact indicators

## Integration Considerations
